# weather-app
 The weather app I built provides current weather conditions. Users can search for a location by city name, and the app displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather data. The app also features a simple and clean user interface that is easy to navigate.

### Additional things installed:
1.  npm i react-accessible-accordion
2. npm i react-select-async-paginate --force
